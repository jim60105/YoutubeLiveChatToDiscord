- The underlying implementation uses yt-dlp instead of the YouTube API, so there is no API quota limit.
- When this tool is idle, it reads the JSON file generated by yt-dlp every 10 seconds.
- Upon startup, it waits for 1 minute to skip old chats before starting monitoring.
  > If you want to skip this waiting and start immediately, please pass the environment variable `SKIP_STARTUP_WAITING`.
- It can monitor membership-only live streams by automatically detect and import the `cookies.txt` file in the execution directory into yt-dlp.
- It is not suitable for for scenarios with a high message speed.
  It sends a maximum of one Discord webhook every two seconds, which may cause delays if the new chat speed exceeds the forwarding speed.
  > Discord has a limitation that allows calling webhooks up to 30 times per minute in the same channel [ref](https://twitter.com/lolpython/status/967621046277820416).  
  > If multiple instances of this tool are simultaneously running and pushed to the same channel, it's easy to trigger Discord cooldown. Please be aware of your usage environment.

## Membership-only (login required) videos

If a file named `cookies.txt` exists in the program's execution directory, it will be used automatically.
